🔧 From metalworker to software development: mine is a journey that encompasses passion, determination and desire to learn.

🛠️ Growing up in a factory environment, I learned the value of work and resilience. Every day between machinery and heavy tools, I cultivated my willpower and perseverance. However, a different flame burned inside me, a burning desire to pursue my dream of becoming a developer.

📚 This is how I decided to undertake a study path parallel to work, signing up to Start2Impact. Where I completed the master's degree in Blockchain Development, developing 5 projects reviewed by industry professionals.

💻 Today, I find myself achieving what once seemed impossible by gaining my first experiences in this sector by learning the development and design of backend solutions.

✨Every day is a new challenge, an opportunity to test myself and to learn more and more.
